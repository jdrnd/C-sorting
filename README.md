### Comparison of Various Sorting Algorithms in C++
Generates a set of `n` random integers, then sorts the set using various sorting algorithms, tracking the time each algorithm takes to complete sorting
Current algorithms implemented:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Quicksort


#### Running
1. Ensure the `clang` compiler is installed.
2. Run the included `build.sh` script
3. Run the produced `sorter` binary and enter the number of elements to sort
